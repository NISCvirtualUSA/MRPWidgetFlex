This code can be executed after being properly installed as a widget in the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex.  
It developed for version 3.6 and uses the Esri 3.6 ArcGIS API for Flex, and Adobe Flash 4.6.0.

For support resources and information on how to download on the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex and the API please go to this site:

The MRP widget was used by CUSEC States during CAPSTONE 14 for viewing resources created using the Mutual Aid Support System (MASS). For background information on this effort please see the following sites:

About the Code
***************

This code was written to consume a ArcGIS Rest Service from Kentucky Emergency Management Agency's Mutual Aid Support System.
As such it requires a specific data model and Flex API to function.
